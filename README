Syllabification and joint wordsegmentation using adaptor grammars

Makefile tackles stress, settling on one specific model of syllable structure
which assumes an initial/final distinction and incorporates obligatory onset/nocoda
biases, as well as optional sonority-sequencing soft-constraints

Makefile_bootstrap performs experiments on a total of 25 sample corpora, the corpus
with index 0 being the original and the corpora from 1-24 being boostrap-resampled
versions

Makefile uses the "old" grammars with absolute or "relative" stress-patterns, whereas
Makefile_bootstrap switched to grammars which allow to switch phonotactics on / off,
switch knowledge of Consonants / Vowels on off, and use a allPatterns-with-Unique-Stress
and a left / right + "extra-metrical"-syllable stress-grammar.

For example, run

make SIZE=10 PYNS=10

for a very brief run on the default corpus (Alex) with the default grammar (colloc3syllIFstress)

make -f Makefile_bootstrap SIZE=10 PYNS=10 FOLDS=0

runs with the default 



programs/ and Makefile contain scripts for running experiments

Data/ contains data

 dataprep/ contains scripts to extract data from inputs
   - there is scripts which interface with the CSV-files John prepared
 dicts/ contains pronunciation dictionary to perform transcription by look-up
